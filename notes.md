    - What questions are they trying to answer?
    - Probe for clarity when questions are vague?
    - driving how we think and make judgemnts; Automatic and immediate perception and then slower and more deliberate cognition
2. Know your data
    - Investigate to find holes
    - See where result seem to be off
    - Know what each grain of data means
3. Use Color purposefully or use shapes and labels
    - Start with everything in basic gray, then Add color only as needed
    - Dont use more than 5 colors
    - Color hue 
    - Orientation
    - Texutre 
    - Position and alignment

# Types of Visualizations
1. Big text: good for KPI's, or high level info and dashboards
2. Tables: Good if you can use a 2 x 2 table, convey comparisons across categories.
3. Heat Map table: takes info you have in a table and colors it based on certain set of parameters.
4. Scatter Plot: best for continuous variable info, discoer inference and view potential data relationships. Perfect for comparing continous variables becase clusers will emerge that can indicate possible correlation 
5. Line graph: Vis data across time, spot trends with time variables, allows for potential forcasting. 
6. Bar graph: Vert, Horizontal and stacked, depending on amount of info you need. Waterfall graphs used to see answer quickly.
